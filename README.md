# Reinforcement-Learning,Neural-Net-Robocode
Built a robocode tank (a Reinforcement Learning agent) that battles with another robot (an enemy) and defeats it ~80% of the time. 


## Before training the battle looks something like this:
- Yellow battle tank : Opponent
- Blue battle tank : My battle tank (Not trained)
